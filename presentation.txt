Ideas for the presentation of Tiabot

Tiabot myth command lists other commands:
kick [@username(s)] throws user(s) overboard
ban [@username(s)] returns user(s) to the cosmic abyss
tablet-of-destinies instigates a primordial battle between (non-admin)
users. Users that fail to please the goddess are cast into the sea.
Last user remaining has the Tablet of Destinies conferred on them by
TiaBot, making them the new ruler of lesser users. 
[[add "TiaBot's Chosen" role to server, and have TiaBot assign to winner]]
